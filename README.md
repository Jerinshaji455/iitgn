THE TASK HERE WAS TO RECORD AN AUDIO OF HEAVY BREATHING USING A HEADSET AND THEN ANALYSE THE SAMPLING RATE OF THE AUDIO SIGNAL, USING MATLAB SIMULATION SOFTWARE. THE PROJECT ALSO FILTERS THE HIGHER FREQUENCY OF THE AUDIO AND HENCE THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF THE BREATHING INFORMATION IS SORTED OUT. THIS PROJECT WAS BASED ON AN INTERNSHIP PROJECT @IITGN. 
Note: i) The Image of the output signal is in the issues section
      ii)The audio signal should be uploaded as sound.mp3 file in matlab to run the code.
